Update (January 26, 2014): After a guy, called Sam got in touch and offered me to help with html&css, I decided to keep development. nginx support will be announced soon!
I made a simple mindmap via mind42, [check it out](http://mind42.com/public/719531ec-5a13-43a6-8d00-62dc9394ecb9)
Have any ideas? [Issue it!](https://github.com/firatakandere/mangareader/issues) or [Mail me!](mailto:f.akandere@gmail.com)
