	<h2>What's FoOlReader?</h2>
		FoOlReader is a modern image browser, specifically meant to be used with <i>comics</i>.
		<br/>
		It's special because it doesn't need page reloads just to change the visualized image, unlike basically every other <i>comic</i> reader.
		<br/><br/>
		It also automatizes a lot of necessary work to display lists of available <i>comics</i>, and has custom themes. It's very easy to install, it works on almost every server, and gets your readers to love your website more.
		<br/><br/>
		It uses the following technologies to work: PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, Woxxy's brain.

	<div class="content" id="install">
		<h2>How to install</h2>
		Just extract the files into a folder with any name you'd like. In example:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/
			</div>
		and put the files in there.
		<br/><br/>
		Then open the file
		<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/settings.php
			</div>
		and add what it asks for.
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3 id="addcomics">How to add <i>comics</i></h3>
		Create a folder called "content". Like this:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/
			</div>
		This folder will contain everything related to your comics.
		<br/><br/>
		Every comic will take name from its folder:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/Sora no Otoshimono/
			</div>
		<br/>
		Same story to add a chapter:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/Sora no Otoshimono/chapter 45/
			</div>
		or any chapter name you'd like:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/Sora no Otoshimono/omake 3/
			</div>
		and the images:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/Sora no Otoshimono/chapter 45/03.png
			</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<h3 id="adddescriptions">How to add comics' descriptions and thumbnails</h3>
		While it will work even without them, you better take some time to add these.
		<br/><br/>
		To add a description, write a file like this:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/Sora no Otoshimono/description.txt
			</div>
		<span class="suggestion">You can use HTML! I suggest using &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; in case it's too much text to be added.</span>
		<br/><br/>
		To add thumbnails, add a small picture like this:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/Sora no Otoshimono/thumb.png
			</div>
		or in jpeg:
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/Sora no Otoshimono/thumb.jpg
			</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<h3>How to enable advertisings</h3>
		There's a
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/ads/
			</div>
		folder, with 3 files. Each filename has the position of the ad.<br/><br/>
		Avoid editing the first line, and add the code for a 728px*90px ad after the second line.
	</div>
	
	<div class="content" id="update">
		<h2>How to update</h2>
		Save on your HD the settings.php and the
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/ads/
			</div>
		folder, just so you have some reference and can copy/paste.<br/><br/>
		Grab the latest version at FoOlRulez.<br/><br/>
		Delete all the folders beside
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/content/
			</div>
		that stores your <i>comics</i>.<br/><br/>
		Upload all the new files from the new version.<br/><br/>
		Update manually 
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/settings.php
			</div>
		and the
			<div class="code">
				/var/www/comicreader/ads/
			</div>
		folder.

		<h2>Suggestions</h2>
		There's always an extra bunch of stuff you don't know. Here's some stuff that might interest you.
		<br/><br/>
		<ul>
			<li><h4 id="suggserver">About the server</h4>
				The kind of server you should prefer using is a VPS (Virtual Private Server), that is a virtualized computer inside a bigger computer, loosely said.
				I suggest never going for servers that offer "infinite bandwidth" and "infinite space", because that's a lie.
				It rather means "it's so slow you will never use so much bandwidth".
				<br/><br/>
				I get often asked on what I host, because it's impressively fast. My host is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linode.com/?r=14a9f753496f4a13247f6e7c53ab454e68f9c959">linode.com</a>,
				capable of pushing over 30mbit/s for the cheapest plan. That's wide enough to fill the bandwidth of the client. I run projects much heavier than this <i>comics</i> reader, and it keeps up like a charm.
				I suggest jumping on their servers if you are in need of a hosting that works great.
				<br/><br/>
				Furthermore, I use Nginx with PHP-FPM as webserver, on Debian 5. 
				Apache is what people use because it's most popular, but serious business when you need to save money requires Nginx.
				It will perform several times faster than Apache. If you're familiar with linux or can at least follow tutorials, google about it.
				<br/><br/>
				What's nice, is that linode has stackscripts, so even setupping Ubuntu with Nginx should be a click away.
				<br/><br/>
				End of shameless linode advertising. Sorry but you guys asked for it.
				<br/><br/>
			</li>
			<li><h4 id="suggbandwidth">About the bandwidth</h4>
				My group is not small, but we use less than 200gb per month, normally, and we also provide direct downloads. It's pretty hard to go over that much bandwidth use, unless your <i>comics</i> are way too popular.
				<br/><br/>
			</li>
			<li><h4 id="suggdevs">For developers and designers</h4>
				The script has a theme system. All themes work like "child themes". You just need to create a new folder with:
				<div class="code">
					/var/www/comicreader/themes/yourthemename/style.css
				</div>All other files will be automatically imported, unless you create substitutes in the same folder.
				<br/><br/>
				I'll provide in-depth documentation for this separately. If you're in a hurry, you can check out the comments in the file
				<div class="code">
					/var/www/comicreader/functions/functions.php
				</div>
				that contains the core of FoOlReader.
				<br/><br/>
			</li>
			<li><h4 id="suggcomics">Why do I always say <i>comics</i> and not manga?</h4>
				Because in the code of FoOlReader there's always written <i>comics</i>. Precisely, you can't say "mangas", and I needed a plural so the names of the functions would be easier to understand. So I used <i>comic</i> instead. And I'll keep doing it.
			</li>
		</ul>
